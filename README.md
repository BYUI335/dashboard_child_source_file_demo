This repository serves as an example to show dashboards structure and how to
reference other files (R scripts, and quarto) from within a quarto file. 

The main dashboard file is called [dashboard_demo.qmd](https://github.com/BYUI335/dashboard_child_source_file_demo/blob/main/dashboard_demo.qmd). Start there. Inside of that file you can see that other files in the same folder are referenced to provide content to the dashboard, while other content is generated within the file itself. Either approach is acceptable. To see the resulting dashboard, [go here](https://posit.byui.edu/connect/#/apps/0e733d40-fa11-4d3f-936f-2b00610e44f7).
